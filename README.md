I am a Senior Solutions Engineer at GitHub currently living in Pittsburgh, PA. Some people have deemed me an "tech translator" or "engineer whisperer". I have an uncanny knack for communicating technical information to a non-technical audience and vice versa. I've given presentations to CEO's, written specs with Product Managers, and debugged issues with Developers. I've worked in Enterprise Software companies as well as a 20 person startup. I've worked in Pre-Sales, Post-Sales, and Support roles. I've worked as Developer, Product Manager, and Sales Engineer. I love working with Sales and Business Development people as much as I love working with Engineers. Over the years, I've taught myself Objective-C, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and more. I've also taught formal 3 day training classes. The free app I developed on iOS to help developers called "The Identifiers" has over 100,000 downloads. (he/him)
